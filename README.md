# Online Charity System
It sounds like you're working on the Online Charity System project, which aims to support charitable donations and manage related activities online. Based on your previous input, this system includes front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a back-end built on Java Servlets, and MySQL for database management.

## Project Overview

The **Online Charity System** is a platform that allows users to donate to various charitable causes, track donations, and manage charity campaigns. The system provides a user-friendly interface for both donors and charities, facilitating transparent and efficient donation processes.

### Key Features:
- **Donor Registration & Login**: Users can register, log in, and view available charity campaigns.
- **Charity Campaign Management**: Charities can create, update, and manage their campaigns.
- **Donation Tracking**: Donors can view donation history and track progress of their contributions.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage users, campaigns, and monitor donation activities.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end**: Java Servlets
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Server**: XAMPP

## System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture where:
1. The **front-end** is responsible for displaying the user interface and interacting with the back-end through RESTful APIs.
2. The **back-end** handles business logic, database operations, and user authentication.
3. The **database** stores user information, donation history, charity campaigns, and other relevant data.
